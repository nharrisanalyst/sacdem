How Sacramentan's voted in the 2016 democrat primary

I Got my data from the sacramento county e-results at http://sacresults.e-cers.com/resultsSW.aspx?type=PRE&map=MPRC

and I got Sacramento County GIS info from http://www.sacgis.org/GISDataPub/Pages/default.aspx


I converted the shape file to geojson and joined it with the csv file using Qgis.

Then I used leaflet and map box with a d3.js geo layer.
